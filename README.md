Not everyone can read quickly (myself included), but for some, [bionic reading (bolding parts of the words in a sentence) really helps to speed up the reading process and makes getting through long paragraphs easier](https://www.howtogeek.com/807981/what-is-bionic-reading-and-how-do-you-use-it/). Hence, here is a quick and dirty implementation of a chrome extension that allows you to highlight text on a webpage and replaces it with the bionic-reading version to enable faster reading of long paragraphs. 

Example:
