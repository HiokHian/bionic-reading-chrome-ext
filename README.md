# bionic-reading-chrome-ext
Not everyone can read quickly (myself included), but for some, [bionic reading (bolding parts of the words in a sentence) really helps to speed up the reading process and makes getting through long paragraphs easier](https://www.howtogeek.com/807981/what-is-bionic-reading-and-how-do-you-use-it/). Hence, here is a quick and dirty implementation of a chrome extension that allows you to highlight text on a webpage and replaces it with the bionic-reading version to enable faster reading of long paragraphs. 

Example:

Future plans:
-[ ] Investigate buggy enabling/disabling of extension
-[ ] Find a way to retain the hyperlinks
-[ ] Allow for PDFs to be parsed in the same way (should be significantly more effort as pdfs/research papers are not easily rendered in html)
